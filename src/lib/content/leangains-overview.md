# Leangains Overview

Leangains is a popular intermittent fasting protocol developed by
Martin Berkhan. It combines fasting periods with strategic eating to
optimize muscle gain and fat loss. Here's an overview of the Leangains
approach:

## Fasting and Eating Windows

- **16/8 Method**: Fast for 16 hours and eat during an 8-hour window.
- **Typical Schedule**: Skip breakfast, have the first meal at noon,
  and the last meal by 8 PM.

## Macronutrient Cycling

- **Workout Days**: Higher carb intake, lower fat intake, consistent
  protein intake.
- **Rest Days**: Lower carb intake, higher fat intake, consistent
  protein intake.

## Training

- **Strength Training**: Focus on compound lifts like squats,
  deadlifts, and bench presses.
- **Workout Timing**: Train in a fasted state or shortly after the
  first meal.

## Benefits

  combining fasting with strategic eating.
- **Simplicity**: No need for calorie counting; focus on macronutrient
  ratios and meal timing.
