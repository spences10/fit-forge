# Understanding Macros: The Building Blocks of Your Diet

Macros, short for macronutrients, are the three main types of
nutrients that make up the food we eat: proteins, carbohydrates, and
fats. Understanding macros can help you make better food choices and
achieve your fitness goals.

## Protein: The Body's Building Material

Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, including
muscles.

- **Common sources:** Chicken breast, eggs, fish, tofu, Greek yogurt
- **Example:** A chicken breast is mostly protein, with a little bit
  of fat

## Carbohydrates: Your Body's Fuel

Carbs are your body's preferred source of energy.

- **Common sources:** Rice, pasta, bread, fruits, vegetables
- **Example:** Fruit juice is mainly carbs, with little to no protein
  or fat

## Fats: Essential for Health

Fats are crucial for hormone production and nutrient absorption.

- **Common sources:** Avocado, nuts, olive oil, fatty fish
- **Example:** An avocado is mostly fat, with some carbs and a little
  protein

## Putting It All Together

Most foods contain a mix of macros. For instance:

- A slice of pizza has all three: carbs (crust), protein (cheese and
  toppings), and fat (cheese and oil)
- A banana is mostly carbs, with a small amount of protein
- Eggs are primarily protein and fat, with almost no carbs

Understanding the macro composition of foods can help you create
balanced meals and snacks that support your health and fitness goals.
