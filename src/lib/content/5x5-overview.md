# 5x5 Overview

The 5x5 workout program is a strength training regimen designed to
build muscle and increase strength. It focuses on compound lifts and
progressive overload. Here's an overview of the 5x5 approach:

## Core Principles

- **Compound Lifts**: Focus on multi-joint exercises like squats,
  deadlifts, bench presses, rows, and overhead presses.
- **5 Sets of 5 Reps**: Perform 5 sets of 5 repetitions for each
  exercise.
- **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase the weight each session
  to continually challenge the muscles.

## Workout Structure

- **Three Workouts Per Week**: Typically performed on non-consecutive
  days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
- **Two Workout Variations**: Alternate between Workout A and Workout
  B.

## Workout A

- Squat: 5x5
- Bench Press: 5x5
- Barbell Row: 5x5

## Workout B

- Squat: 5x5
- Overhead Press: 5x5
- Deadlift: 1x5

## Benefits

- **Strength Gains**: Focuses on building strength through heavy
  lifting and progressive overload.
- **Muscle Growth**: Compound lifts engage multiple muscle groups,
  promoting overall muscle growth.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to follow with a clear structure and minimal
  equipment needed.

## Tips for Success

- **Warm-Up**: Always warm up before lifting to prevent injury.
- **Proper Form**: Focus on maintaining proper form to maximize
  effectiveness and reduce the risk of injury.
- **Rest and Recovery**: Allow adequate rest between sets and workouts
  to support muscle recovery and growth.

The 5x5 workout program is a straightforward and effective way to
build strength and muscle. As with any exercise program, it's
important to consult with a healthcare professional or fitness expert
before starting.
